### Hi, Welcome To My Github Profile ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from an Anatolian High School in Istanbul and recently completed my studies at Trakya University. While I may lack prior work experience in my field, I am dedicated to continuous self-improvement. Currently, I am enrolled in coding courses on Udemy, with a primary focus on C# and Flutter, and I am working towards obtaining certificates upon completion. Additionally, I am actively pursuing English language courses to further enhance my proficiency.

In terms of my skills, I possess a strong proficiency in playing chess and hold a chess license. During my university education, I gained knowledge in various programming languages:

In my first year, I delved into Python and HTML.
In my second year, I explored C and Java.
Moving into my third year, I deepened my expertise in C# and React.
In the first semester of my fourth year, I honed my skills in advanced Java programming.
Among these languages, I excel in C# and Flutter programming, while maintaining basic to intermediate competence in the others. My unwavering passion for my field motivates me to continually seek opportunities for knowledge and skill expansion.

Currently, I am engaged in an internship at AltÄ±nay Robot Technologies A.Åž. During my first internship, I developed a mobile application specializing in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Flutter in the Industrial Automation Technologies Software department.

In my current internship, I am creating a webpage using C# and HTML. This webpage serves as a database management system, housing information about the company's current personnel and company vehicles. It efficiently matches suitable vehicles with employees based on their respective locations.
